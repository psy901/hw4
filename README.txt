I acknowledge for Juan Jose who is the first creator of this code
(https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4)
I customized for myself so that it has trap state with proper negative rewards.

- install 'maven'
- git clone https://github.com/psy901/hw4.git

Files to run each map
- src/main/java/myProj/EasyGridWorldLauncher.java for 'Easy Map'
